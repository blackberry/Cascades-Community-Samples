BBMSPUserProfile

Demonstrates how to register an application with the BlackBerry Messenger Social Platform
and read and update the user's BlackBerry Messenger Profile using the
BlackBerry Platform Services (bps) style BBM SP library.  Use this sample if you are already
using the bps library within your application.  Otherwise I recommend using the BBM SP Qt library. 

This sample is designed to easily plug into an existing application.  
Your exising UI could be displayed within RegistrationHandler::continueToMainAppScreen() of 
RegistrationHandler.cpp. 


BEFORE YOU RUN THIS SAMPLE
Edit RegistrationHandler::RegistrationHandler in RegistrationHandler.cpp and set your
UUID (Universally unique identifier).  DO NOT USE THE EXAMPLE UUID IN THIS SAMPLE.
