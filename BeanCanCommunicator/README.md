# Bean Can Communicator

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use NfcShareManager to send text between two devices using NFC peer to peer mode. It is also intended to entertain due to the blatantly frivolous nature of the app :-) 

To use the application:

* install and run it on two BlackBerry 10 devices
* On one device, touch the text input field at the top of the screen and enter a short message
* Press enter (virtual keyboard) or touch the screen outside the text input area (physical keyboard) and marvel at the way your "note" floats down into the can and along the string
* Touch your device to the other one, back to back so the NFC antennae line up
* The second device will make a noise like an old phone ringing (make sure your volume is turned up) and the text entered on the first device will appear on the second device in a small note which will slide along the string to the can, then float upwards until it is "parked" on the screen near the top

**Release History**

* **V1** - Initial release

**Known Issues**

When using the app on a BlackBerry 10 device with physical keyboard, it should not be necessary to touch away from the text input field to trigger the sharing action and animation. Pressing the physical enter key should trigger the event in the same way that pressing enter on a virtual keyboard does. This will be addressed in a future release.

**Dependencies**

1. BlackBerry 10 Device Software **10.0.9**
1. BlackBerry 10 Native SDK **10.0.9** (Gold)

**How to Build BeanCanCommunicator**

Simply Import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported paying particular attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file. It should be changed to reflect values in the **&lt;author&gt;** and **&lt;authorId&gt;** elements that are appropriate for you.
 
**But I don't want to build it myself**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a 
pre-build and signed BAR files for each version. You can find them in the 
folder **"/installable-bar-files"** as follows:

* **BeanCanCommunicator-1\_0\_0\_21.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1 (V1) of the application ( requires BlackBerry 10 Software 10.0.9 )
