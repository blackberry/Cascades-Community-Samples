# BtDeviceInfo -- Bluetooth Device Information Service Viewer

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to connect to and use the Bluetooth GATT Device Information Service on any Bluetooth Smart / Low Energy device that supports it. In itself, the application is useful in letting you discover various attributes of a Bluetooth Smart device. 

Note that you must pair/connect to the Bluetooth Smart device in Settings-Bluetooth before it will be available to this application from the Scan screen.

**How to Build BtDeviceInfo**

Simply import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported; for example, paying attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file.

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a pre-built and signed BAR file. You can find it in the folder "**installable-bar-files**".
