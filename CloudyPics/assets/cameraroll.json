/* 
Camera roll object format
-------------------------

name: Name to be displayed to the user
path: Path to set the camera roll. If selected, this will be created if it does not exist. Relative paths refer to the app's root directory.
required path: This path needs to exist for this camera roll optoin to be considered "avaliable". 
	For example, "Dropbox" is available in shared/Dropbox/. If that folder does not exist, Dropbox is not present on the device.
	The actual images should be stored in something like shared/Dropbox/photos/, which may or may not exist even if the root Dropbox folder does.
description: This text will be displayed to the user to give more details on the camera roll path

NOTE:
The camera roll can NOT be directed into the app's private data directory, because the camera service does not have access to it.
If you want to do that, you would have to move it yourself once the photo is captured.
