# Filtermama Lite

Filtermama Lite, written by [@chadtatro](http://www.twitter.com/chadtatro) is a full-blown "Showcase" application written for BlackBerry 10. It combines the flexibility of JavaScript, with the power of BlackBerry Cascades, and C++ to deliver a true **Hybrid** app.

The "full" version of [Filtermama](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/27283379) is available for free in BlackBerry World.

If you'd like to learn more about Hybrid apps, and specifically how I made Filtermama, a full write-up is available here: [Nobody puts Filtermama in the corner](http://palebanana.com/nobody-puts-filtermama-in-the-corner/)

**Built for BlackBerry**

Filtermama has passed testing, and is designated as a [Built for BlackBerry](http://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/) app. I used the Built for BlackBerry boilerplate to get started quick. There are two Cascades versions available.

* [10.1 BfB Boilerplate](https://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Samples/tree/master/BfB-Boilerplate-10.1)
