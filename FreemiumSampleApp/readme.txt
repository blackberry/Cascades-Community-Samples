FreemiumSampleApp

========================================================================
Sample Description.

This sample demonstrates one possible implementation of a freemium business
model. The game mocked up in this sample, "BYO UFO", allows users to purchase
various upgrades to their UFO as well as remove adverts from the application.

There is no gameplay in the app itself, the main goal was to show how the 
freemium model could be implemented and how easy it is to sell digital
goods, in this case all actions are handled in QML.

Note: All images of the UFO as well as UFO accessories and backgrounds were
      created by me, Garett Beukeboom, and can be used freely without issue.
