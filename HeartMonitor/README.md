# HeartMonitor -- Bluetooth Low Energy Application

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use selected 
BlackBerry 10 Bluetooth Low Energy APIs in the context of a practical real-world use case. The Release History section gives details of those APIs which are covered and any changes as the sample evolves over time.

The use case examines how to interface to a Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Monitor device in order to acquire and display data from the device. The application uses the standard Heart Rate Service ([overview available here](http://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/HRS.aspx)) as specificied by the Bluetooth SIG enabling it to interwork with any Bluetooth Smart device that implements this profile.

The sample code for this application is Open Source under 
the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

**How to Build HeartMonitor**

Simply Import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported paying particular attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file. It should be changed to reflect values in the **&lt;author&gt;** and **&lt;authorId&gt;** elements that are appropriate for you.

**What else will I need?**

You will need a Bluetooth Smart ( Low Energy) heart rate monitor that supports the standard [Heart Rate Service](http://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/HRS.aspx) and pair it to the BlackBerry 10 device before using the application.

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a 
pre-build and signed BAR file. You can find it in the 
folder "installable-bar-files" as follows:

* **HeartMonitor-1\_0\_1\_203.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1.0.1 (V1.0.1) of the application ( minimal requirement BlackBerry 10 Software 10.0.9 )
* **HeartMonitor-1\_0\_0\_202.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1.0 (V1.0) of the application ( minimal requirement BlackBerry 10 Software 10.0.9 )

**To contribute code to this repository you must be [signed up as an 
official contributor](http://blackberry.github.com/howToContribute.html).**

**Devices we've tested with**

* Wahoo Blue HR
* Polar H7
* Zephyr HxM Smart

**Known Issues**

* You should ensure that the heart rate monitor that you use has been paired with the BlackBerry 10 device before using the application. Dynamic pairing will be added as a later release of this application.
