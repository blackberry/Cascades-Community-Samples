The purpose of this code is to share the Bluetooth remote control as used in the BatBerry and for my holiday train. 
It could be the basis for controlling... anything...

The following hardware was used to complete this project.

1. Arduino Uno R3
2. SeeedStudio Bluetooth Shield
3. Other components are listed in the circuit diagram
