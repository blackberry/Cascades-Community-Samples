Sample Description.

This sample allows you to advertise whatever you would like within your
app! It has built-in support for web sites as well as the ability to 
launch BlackBerry World directly to a specified app.

Advertise your apps, refer users to sites for referral bonuses, find
friends in the forum and swap ad banners etc etc. 

For tracking effectiveness you can also integrate Flurry Analytics
to your app and see how often users are interacting with your
Banner!

The idea for this sample was taken from Brian Schierer (@BrianScheirer)
who did a very similar sample which he uses in his own apps. Big kudos
to Brian!
