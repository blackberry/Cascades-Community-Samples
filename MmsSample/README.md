# MmsSample -- MMS Messaging

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use the BlackBerry 10 messaging APIs to send and receive MMS messages from within a BlackBerry 10 native application. 

The sample code for this application is Open Source under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

* [Cascades for BlackBerry 10](https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/cascades/)

**Author** 

* [Martin Woolley](https://github.com/mdwoolley)

1. Minimal requirement for BlackBerry 10 Device Software is **10.2.0**
1. Minimal requirement for BlackBerry 10 Native SDK is **10.2.0**

**How to Build MmsSample**

Simply import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported; for example, paying attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file.

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a pre-built and signed BAR file. You can find it in the folder "**installable-bar-files**" as follows:

* **MmsSample-1\_0\_0\_1.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1.0 (V1.0) of the application (requires BlackBerry 10 Software 10.2.0 or later).

**To contribute code to this repository you must be [signed up as an official contributor](http://blackberry.github.com/howToContribute.html).**

**Known Issues**
