# NfcRaceTimeWay -- Fun Run Application

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use selected 
BlackBerry 10 NFC APIs in the context of a practical real-world use case. The Release History section gives details of those NFC APIs which are covered an any changes as the sample evolves over time.

The use case examines how to use an NFC Tag to trigger the starting and stopping of a timer in the application that could be used in the context of an event like a "fun run". In addition it demonstrates how to use Virtual Tag Emulation to pass information from the handset to an NFC reader that could be used to support the use of way points during the evvent.

**Release History**

* **V1.1** - Initial release

**Dependencies**

1. BlackBerry Dev Alpha Device Beta 3 Software **10.0.9**
1. BlackBerry 10 Native SDK **10.0.9**

**How to Build NfcRaceTimeWay**

Simply Import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported paying particular attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file. It should be changed to reflect values in the **&lt;author&gt;** and **&lt;authorId&gt;** elements that are appropriate for you.

**What else will I need?**

You will also need two NFC tags. One to start the timer and one to stop the timer. They should have the following NDEF content.

1. Tag used to *start* the timer
	1. NDEF TNF = External ( integer value 4 )
	1. Type = "my.rim.com:myrecordtype"
	1. Payload = "start"
1. Tag used to *stop* the timer
	1. NDEF TNF = External ( integer value 4 )
	1. Type = "my.rim.com:myrecordtype"
	1. Payload = "stop"
 
This aplication also emulates a virtual NFC tag with contents that represent the calue of the time currently displayed on the handset. If you want to read this data from another device or NFC reader you need to know the format of the NDEF Message in the virtual tag emulated by the application.

1. Virtual tag emulated by the application
	1. NDEF TNF = External ( integer value 4 )
	1. Type = "my.rim.com:myrecordtype"
	1. Payload = "hh:mm:ss"
		1. That is the time displayed on the handset in:
			1. Hours (hh);
			1. Minutes (mm), and;
			1. Seconds (ss).; 

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a 
pre-build and signed BAR file. You can find it in the 
folder "installable-bar-files" as follows:

* **NfcRaceTime-1\_1\_0\_10.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1.1 (V1.1) of the application ( requires BlackBerry Dev Alpha Beta 3 Device Software (10.0.9) )

**Known Issues**

None.
