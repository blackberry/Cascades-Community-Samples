# NFC Tag Reading and Writing Sample

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use selected 
BlackBerry 10 NFC APIs. The Release History section gives details of

**How to Build NfcTool**

We took the decision to distribute only the contents of the **"src/"** and **"assets/"** 
directories along with the **"NfcTool.pro"** file with this example.

We've found it to be the more reliable technique whilst the meta-data associated with 
an NDK project is still subject to change between versions of the NDK. You are less 
likely to run into issues with a project if you create it as a new empty project 
in your workspace and copy files into it rather than import a project with a 
structure from an older version of the IDE.

Here's what you should do:

* Create a new empty Cascades C++ project in your workspace called **"NfcTool"**
    * **File** > **New** > BlackBerry Cascades C++ Project
    * Enter Project Name: **NfcTool** > **Next**
    * Select: **Standard empty project** > **Finish**
* You've now got a clean project set up appropriately for your version of the IDE
* Delete the **"app.cpp"** and **"app.hpp"** files from the project's **"src/"** directory -- we don't need them
* Replace contents of the **"src/"** and **"assets/"** directories in the project by the contents of **"src/"** and **"assets/"* from this repo
* Replace **"NfcTool.pro"** in the project by the one in this repo
    * This file just ensure that the **"libnfc.so"** and **"libnfc_bps.so"** libraries are available to the build process since they're not included in the library path by default.
* You'll also now have a **"bar-descriptor.xml"** which is correct for your verion of the IDE.
    * You need to make sure it's populated with your own **Debug Token** 
    * Also, if you want to ensure that the application has the correct icon and startup splash screen (I'm sure you do!) open the **"bar-descriptor.xml"** file, select the **"Application"** tab and choose:
        * **"assets/images/generic\_tag.png"** as the **Icon image**
        * **"assets/images/splash\_landscape.png"** and **"assets/images/splash.png"** as the **"Landscape"** and **"Portrait"** splash screen images respectively.
	* In BlackBerry Dev Alpha Device Software 10.0.6 the **Invocation Framework** is now used to register an application to be notified when an NFC NDEF tag is presented to the device. You need to add this registration to your **"bar-descriptor.xml"** file. The registration that we use in this sample application is shown in the code section below.

		Add this stanza to your **"bar-descriptor.xml"** file at the end, just before the closing **"&lt;/qnx&gt;"** tag. The meaning of the various fields is described in the article that accompanies this code sample.

**But I don't want to build it myself**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a 
pre-build and signed BAR files for each version. You can find them in the 
folder "installable-bar-files" as follows:

* **NfcTool-2_1_0_2.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 2.1 (V2.1) of the application ( requires BlackBerry Dev Alpha Device Software 10.0.6 )
* **NfcTool-2_0_0_1.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 2 (V2) of the application  ( requires BlackBerry Dev Alpha Device Software 10.0.4 )
* **NfcTool-1_0_0_1.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1 (V1) of the application ( requires BlackBerry Dev Alpha Device Software 10.0.4 )
