# NFC Tag Reading and Writing Sample

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to read and write various sorts of NDEF messages from and to NFC tags using the BlackBerry 10 NFC APIs.

**How to Build NfcTool**

We took the decision to distribute only the contents of the "src/" and "assets/" directories along with the "NfcTool.pro" file with this example.

We've found it to be the more reliable technique whilst the meta-data associated with an NDK project is still subject to change between versions of the NDK. You are less likely to run into issues with a project if you create it as a new empty project in your workspace and copy files into it rather than import a project with a structure from an older version of the IDE.

Here's what you should do:

* Create a new empty Cascades C++ project in your workspace called "NfcTool"
    * File > New > BlackBerry Cascades C++ Project
    * Enter Project Name: NfcTool > Next
    * Select: Standard empty project > Finish
* You've now got a clean project set up appropriately for your version of the IDE
* Delete the "app.cpp" and "app.hpp" files from the project's "src/" directory -- we don't need them
* Replace contents of the "src/" and "assets/" directories in the project by the contents of "src/" and "assets/" from this repo
* Replace "NfcTool.pro" in the project by the one in this repo
    * This file just ensure that the "libnfc.so" library is available to the build process since it's not included in the library path by default.
* You'll also now have a "bar-descriptor.xml" which is correct for your verion of the IDE.
    * You need to make sure it's populated with your own Debug Token 
    * Also, if you want to ensure that the application has the correct icon and startup splash screen (I'm sure you do!) open the "bar-descriptor.xml" file, select the "Application" tab and choose:
        * "assets/images/generic_tag.png" as the Icon image
        * "assets/images/generic_tag.png" as both the "Landscape" and "Portrait" splash screen images
