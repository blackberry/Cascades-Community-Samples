# PasswordSample

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how the BlackBerry 10 Security Builder API together with standard features of Qt and Cascades might be used to implement a basic user ID and password based login screen whilst allowing the user credentials to be stored safely locally (as in this case) or remotely using one-way encryption of the password rendering it unusable to those with access to the credentials store.

In addition to demonstrating a simple application of the Security Builder APIs, this sample also includes:

* A custom control. The Timer class is exposed to QML and used to remove status messages after a 5 second delay.
* Dynamic management of Tabs in a TabbedPane
* Simple animations. Go on.... touch one of the padlock graphics. You know you want to.....
* Covers.
  * Minimise the application when either "logged in" or not logged in and note the image on the minimised application's Active Frame 
* Use of QSettings for simple persistent storage of name/value pairs

**How to Build PasswordSample**

Simply Import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported paying particular attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file. It should be changed to reflect values in the **&lt;author&gt;** and **&lt;authorId&gt;** elements that are appropriate for you.
 
**But I don't want to build it myself**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a 
pre-build and signed BAR files for each version. You can find them in the 
folder **"/installable-bar-files"** as follows:

* **PasswordSample-1\_0\_0\_11.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1 (V1) of the application ( requires BlackBerry Dev Alpha Device Beta 4 Software 10.0.9 )
