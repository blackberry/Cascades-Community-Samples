blackberry-py-pulltorefresh
===========================

A BlackBerry-Py sample that demonstrates pull-to-refresh with the App.net global stream.

Works on the release version of BlackBerry 10.0.9. Currently uses BBPy (http://blackberry-py.microcode.ca/) but the QML should work just fine in your C++-based project so you can implement pull-to-refresh functionality.
