SimplePushClient

========================================================================
Sample Description.

This sample provides 2 basic functions of a BlackBerry Push Initiator. Namely it 
will support:
1) Send a message to one or more recipients
2) Request a list of currently active push subscribers

This sample makes use of pre-defined template files which follow the conventions 
expected by the push service. As a developer you should be able to add extra 
functionality by adding additional templates then following the same flow used 
by the app to swap out information to make the request relevant to the desired 
call.

Note: This sample was designed to work in tandem with the SimplePushServer app 
      though it could easily be modified to push to any client.
