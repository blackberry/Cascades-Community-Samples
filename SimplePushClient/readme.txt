SimplePushClient

========================================================================
Sample Description.

This sample allows for receiving push messages at various priority levels;
the level will determine how intrusive the notification to the end user will
be. The app also integrates with the SceneCover to provide details on app
activity to the end user even when the application is thumbnailed.

Note: This sample was designed to work in tandem with the SimplePushServer app 
      though it could easily be modified to push to any client.
