This sample demonstrates how to create an application to receive messages
sent using the BlackBerry Push Service. The sample has been created for use 
with both 10.2.1 OS devices using the new headless application frameworks,
as well as devices running earlier OS versions for legacy support.

Please reference either sub-directory for the respective application and
further details on how to customize either sample to work with your push 
account.
