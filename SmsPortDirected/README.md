**How to Build SmsMessageService**

Simply import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported; for example, paying attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file.

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a pre-built and signed BAR file. You can find it in the folder "**installable-bar-files**" as follows:

* **SmsMessageService-1\_0\_0\_1.bar** -- Signed BAR file for Version 1.0 (V1.0) of the application (requires BlackBerry 10 Software 10.0.9 or later).
