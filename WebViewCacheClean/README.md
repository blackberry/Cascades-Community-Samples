WebViewCacheClean
================================================================================================

WebViewCacheClean is a sample showing how to calculate the cache size of your webviews, display the cache size in human readable form, and clear that cache via the app settings.
================================================================================================
Notes:

After importing this project into the BlackBerry Native IDE, compile and run. The app loads http://opensourcebb.com, and once loaded the cache will no longer be empty. Swipe from the top and tap "Settings" and the cache size will be shown along with a button that will clear the cache.
