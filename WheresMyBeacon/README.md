# WheresMyBeacon

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to develop an application for BlackBerry 10 which is capable of decoding the advertisement data sent by an [Estimote](http://www.estimote.com) beacon; and by extension [iBeacons](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6048)(TM).

The sample code for this application is Open Source under 
the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

**Applies To**

* [Cascades for BlackBerry 10](https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/cascades/)

**Author(s)** 

* [John Murray](https://github.com/jcmurray)
* [Martin Woolley](https://github.com/mdwoolley)

**Release History**

* **V1.0.0** - Initial release
* **V1.0.1** - Added an "About" page and improved layout of iBeacon(TM) information in ListView.
* **V2.0.0** - Added ability to associate a friendly name with a beacon to aid identification. Added beacon configuration screen to allow SensorTag beacon attributes to be modified. 
* **V2.0.1** - Minor change to deal with warnings about an API deprecated in 10.3.0 when building against the 10.3.0 SDK and above. No functional changes, hence no replacement pre-built signed BAR file.

* None

**Dependencies**

1. BlackBerry Device Software **10.2.0** and greater

**How to Build WheresMyBeacon**

Simply Import the project into a workspace in your NDK. 

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a pre-built and signed BAR file. You can find it in the folder "**installable-bar-files**".
 
**To contribute code to this repository you must be [signed up as an
