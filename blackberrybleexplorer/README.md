# BlackBerryBleExplorer -- Bluetooth Low Energy Explorer

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use selected BlackBerry 10 Bluetooth Low Energy APIs to explore the attributes including GATT Services and Characteristics of a Bluetooth Low Energy device. The Release History section gives details of those APIs which are covered and any changes as the sample evolves over time.

**How to Build BlackBerryBleExplorer**

Simply Import the project into a workspace in your NDK. Of course you should review the project after it's been imported paying particular attention to the settings in the **bar-descriptor.xml** file.

**What else will I need?**

You will need one or more Bluetooth Smart (Low Energy) devices and pair them to the BlackBerry 10 device before using the application.

**But I don't want to build it myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a pre-build and signed BAR file. You can find it in the 
folder "installable-bar-files" as follows:
