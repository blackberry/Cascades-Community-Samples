# HostCardEmulation

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to develop an application for BlackBerry 10 which that uses Near Field Communication (**NFC**) Host Card Emulation (**HCE**) that is capable of responding to a subset of **EMV**(tm) commands from a Point of Sale Terminal.

The sample code for this application is Open Source under 
the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

* [Cascades for BlackBerry 10](https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/cascades/)

**Author(s)** 

* [John Murray](https://github.com/jcmurray)

**Release History**

* **V1.0.0** - Initial release
* **V1.0.1** - Correct the AID registration code for 10.3
* **V1.0.2** - Fix logic around button enabling/disabling with HCE in 10.3

**Known Issues**

* There is an issue with running this on devices running, specifically, ***10.3 GOLD*** (***10.3.0.698***). This has been fixed for subsequent ***10.3*** versions. I'd recommend running this on version ***10.2.1*** initially.
