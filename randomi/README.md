This sample demonstrates how you can override the default navigation behaviour of Cascades controls to ensure you give users on a Classic more intuitive scrolling.
 
In this sample the letters are mixed up, but scrolling right or down will progress in alphabetical order and left or up will do the reverse.
 
Use this technique to give your custom layouts a logical scrolling order if the default feels wrong.
